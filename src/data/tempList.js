        "Heat the oven to 150C/300F and prepare two baking trays covered with parchment. In a large bowl, stir together the oats, coconut, flour, sugar and salt. Meanwhile melt the butter and syrup together in a small pot over low heat. Stir the baking soda into the boiling water, then stir this into the butter and syrup mixture. And pour all of it over the flour mixture. Mix well, then shape the mixture into 32 balls and place onto the prepared baking sheets. Press down to flatten the cookie balls with your palm. Bake for 12 15 minutes, switching the pan around if you need to for even baking, until the cookies are golden brown. Leave them on the baking trays for 5 minutes before removing them with a spatula to cool on a rack.",
